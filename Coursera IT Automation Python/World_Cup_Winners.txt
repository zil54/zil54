Annotation
	
Description
[Fact] 	Marks a test method, i.e., actual test in a class
Assert.Throws Record Exception 	Verify the raise and raise assert, irrespective of the place in the code where the problem occurs.
Constructor 	This is not an attribute but is an ideal replacement for the [SetUp] attribute. The constructor should be parameter-less.
IDisposable.Dispose 	This is not an attribute but is an ideal replacement for the [TearDown] attribute. This is where the code for performing necessary cleanup and de-initialization is included.

The decision to do away with [TearDown] was made as the investors of xUnit felt that a lot of unnecessary code was run before every single test execution.
[Trait] 	Used to set arbitrary meta-data on a test
[Theory] 	This attribute is used when data-driven tests have to be executed. In such cases, [Theory] has to be used instead of [Fact] attribute
[InlineData] 	This attribute is used along with the [Theory] attribute to supply a subset of data against which parameterized tests will be executed.
[ClassData] 	This attribute is used when the parameters being passed to the [Theory] tests are not constants.
[Theory] [ClassData(typeof(some-data))]
[MemberData] 	This attribute can be used to fetch data for [Theory] from a static method. The most common approach is to load the data from the property of a test class, i.e., using IEnumerable&lt: object[] > 

[Test] 	[TestMethod] 	[Fact] 	Marks a test method.
[TestFixture] 	[TestClass] 	n/a 	xUnit.net does not require an attribute for a test class; it looks for all test methods in all public (exported) classes in the assembly.
Assert.That
Record.Exception 	[ExpectedException] 	Assert.Throws
Record.Exception 	xUnit.net has done away with the ExpectedException attribute in favor of Assert.Throws. See Note 1
[SetUp] 	[TestInitialize] 	Constructor 	We believe that use of [SetUp] is generally bad. However, you can implement a parameterless constructor as a direct replacement. See Note 2
[TearDown] 	[TestCleanup] 	IDisposable.Dispose 	We believe that use of [TearDown] is generally bad. However, you can implement IDisposable.Dispose as a direct replacement. See Note 2
[OneTimeSetUp] 	[ClassInitialize] 	IClassFixture<T> 	To get per-class fixture setup, implement IClassFixture<T> on your test class. See Note 3
[OneTimeTearDown] 	[ClassCleanup] 	IClassFixture<T> 	To get per-class fixture teardown, implement IClassFixture<T> on your test class. See Note 3
n/a 	n/a 	ICollectionFixture<T> 	To get per-collection fixture setup and teardown, implement ICollectionFixture<T> on your test collection. See Note 3
[Ignore("reason")] 	[Ignore] 	[Fact(Skip="reason")] 	Set the Skip parameter on the [Fact] attribute to temporarily skip a test.
[Property] 	[TestProperty] 	[Trait] 	Set arbitrary metadata on a test
[Theory] 	[DataSource] 	[Theory]
[XxxData] 	Theory (data-driven test).
